Overview

The tidy_data_set.txt file is a tidy subset of the data provided in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. The source data is available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#. 


The tidy data set is a subset of this combined data that includes only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measure. This reduces the data to . The size of the tidy data set was further reduced by averaging each variable for each activity and each subject. This resulted in 180 rows of data with 68 columns.  

Data Dictionary
----------
Subject - A factor that identifies the volunteer participant.
Values: integer from 1 to 30
